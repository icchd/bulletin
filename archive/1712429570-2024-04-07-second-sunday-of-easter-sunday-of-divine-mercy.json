   "title": "Second Sunday of Easter                                                                           Sunday of Divine Mercy",
   "text": "Introduction: The readings for this Sunday are about God’s\nmercy, the necessity for trusting Faith, and our need for the\nforgiveness of our sins. The opening prayer addresses the\nFather as “God of everlasting Mercy.” In the Responsorial\nPsalm (Ps 118), we repeat several times, “His mercy endures\nforever!” God revealed His mercy, first and foremost, in\nsending His only-begotten Son to become our Savior and\nLord through His suffering, death and Resurrection. Divine\nMercy is given to us also in each celebration of the\nSacraments, instituted to sanctify us.\nScripture lessons: The first reading, taken from Acts,\nstresses the corporal acts of mercy practiced by the early\nChristian community before the Jews and the Romans\nstarted persecuting them. Practicing the sharing love,\ncompassion and the mercy of God as Jesus taught, this\nwitnessing community derived its strength from community\nprayer, “the Breaking of the Bread” and the apostles’\nteaching read at the worship service. The second reading: taken from John’s first Letter, deals with practicing both corporal\nand spiritual works of mercy by obeying God’s Old Testament commandments and focusing on Jesus’ commandment of\nloving others as He loves us, with selfless, sacrificial, agape love. Loving others as Jesus loves us also demands that we treat\nothers with God’s mercy and compassion. Today’s Gospel vividly reminds us of how Jesus instituted the Sacrament of\nReconciliation, a sacrament of Divine Mercy. The Risen Lord gave his apostles the power to forgive sins with the words,\n“Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained” (Jn 20:19-23). Presenting the doubting\nThomas’ famous profession of Faith, “My Lord and my God” (Jn 20:28), the Gospel illustrates how Jesus showed Divine\nmercy to the doubting apostle and emphasizes the importance of Faith.\nLife messages: 1) We need to accept God’s invitation to celebrate and practice mercy in our Christian lives: One way the\nChurch celebrates God’s mercy throughout the year is through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Finding time for Adoration\nof the Blessed Sacrament is another good way to receive and give thanks for Divine Mercy. But it is mainly through the\ncorporal and spiritual works of mercy that we practice mercy in our daily lives and become eligible for God’s merciful\njudgment. 2) Let us ask God for the Faith that culminates in self-surrender to God and that leads us to serve those we\nencounter with love. Living Faith enables us to see the risen Lord in everyone and gives us the willingness to render to each\none our loving service. The spiritual Fathers prescribe the following traditional means to grow in the living and dynamic\nfaith of St. Thomas the Apostle: a) First, we must come to know Jesus personally and intimately by our daily and meditative\nreading of the Bible. b) Next, we must strengthen our Faith through our personal and community prayer. c) Third, we must\nshare in the Divine Life of Jesus by frequenting the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Holy Eucharist. St. Teresa of\nCalcutta (Mother Teresa) presents it this way: “If we pray, we will believe; if we believe, we will love; if we love, we will\nserve. Only then we put our love of God into action.”",
