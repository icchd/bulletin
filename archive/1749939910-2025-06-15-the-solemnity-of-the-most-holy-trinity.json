   "title": "The Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity",
   "text": "This solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity is one that we celebrate after completing ninety days of Lent and Easter during which we recalled and entered more deeply into the Paschal Mystery. The mystery of the Trinity has been written about for two millennia and numerous attempts have been made to try to explain it. It is best to begin with the definition found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church;\n\n“The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching in the “hierarchy of the truths of faith.” The whole history of salvation is identical with the history of the way and the means by which the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men and reconciles and unites with himself those who turn away from sin. But it is a mystery and can never be fully understood.”\n\nWhile the catechism doesn’t explain the mystery it gives us a good foundation on which to build our Faith as we celebrate the mystery. We might be tempted today with getting bogged down with trying to wrap our minds around an unsolvable mystery, rather let us allow the mystery of God to wrap himself around our hearts and souls and fill us with a deeper experience and appreciation of God. There are numerous resources and Religious Education Classes that provide us with opportunities to wrestle with understanding this myster.\n\nThrough Baptism we are all united with God and one another. The mystery of the Triune God fills us with the Love of the Father, the Peace of Christ, and the unity of the Holy Spirit. We are united with God who draws us into His family, he is the loving Father, he is the Son, our Brother, who brings us Peace, and the Holy Spirit who sanctifies us.\n\nWe first experienced the Trinity at the moment of our conception when God breathed into the act of love of our parents’ life and soul. God has been with us from our conception and remains with us forever. We were Baptized in the name of, The Father, and of The Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and became a member of God’s Family. We went on to receive Jesus in Holy Communion, and the Holy Spirit at Confirmation.\n\nIn addition to these Sacraments there are the times we encounter the Trinity in other ways. It could be the silent prayers at home or at some retreat or spiritual gathering were the words of someone, a song, or a prayer, struck the heart with the reassurance that God is with us. It could be the unexpected encounter with someone in need, whether it be a kind word and encouragement, or a simple ride somewhere, or even a loan, that we realize that we just helped Jesus. The Trinity is itself a mystery that we will never solve, and it is also a mystery how God can be so attentive to us at every moment of our lives. God is a Trinity of persons who is always with us. The mystery of the Holy Trinity is one to behold with awe and to celebrate with joy. May we experience the unity of the Most Holy Trinity in a way that unites us more closely with the three persons of our One God, and with each other.",
