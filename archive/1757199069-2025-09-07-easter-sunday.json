   "text": "God first in our lives in order to become His disciple. This takes much wisdom and fortitude; but \nonce understood and accepted, the results are almost overwhelming. When Our Lord Jesus \nChrist is the first priority in our life, all other things--family, neighbors, jobs, possessions, etc.-\nfall into their rightful place; and we are at peace with the world. A wonderful feeling indeed!  \nNow returning to the First Reading from the Book of Wisdom (9:13-18B), we read that the \nmind of God is so far above that of mortal man that we should defer to God all of our decisions \nand, indeed, all of our life. In return, God will direct us toward eternal peace and happiness, not \nnecessarily on earth, but in heaven. In the meantime, if we follow the Holy Spirit's directions, we \ncan be assured of that ultimate goal. \nThe Responsorial Psalm, (90:3-6, 12- 17) reminds us of how short this earthly life really is as \nwell as our need to depend on God for guidance and direction to stay on the path that leads to \nHis throne. It sounds so submissive, but we must remember what was said last week about the \nneed for humility. Submission to the will of God requires both wisdom and humility. \nThe Second Reading is from St. Paul's Letter to Philemon (1:9-10, 12- 17). (USCCB says 9\n10, 12-17) In it, Paul gives us two good examples of the Cost of Discipleship. The first is his own \nlife, which as we know was turned completely around in order to serve Jesus first and foremost; \nand the second is Paul's servant Onesimus. Onesimus was a Greek slave who escaped from his \nowner and converted to Christianity. As a test, he is being sent back to his rightful owner with \nthe hopes and prayers of Paul that The theme of the Readings for today follows the readings of \nlast Sunday where the focus is on humility. For this Sunday, we are dealing with the Cost of \nDiscipleship. To better understand the readings we need to discuss the Gospel first and then \nreturn to the usual order.  \nThe Gospel Reading is taken from the Gospel of Luke (14:25-33). As mentioned above, this is \na continuation of last week's gospel on the subject of \"humility\" and it takes a lot of humility to \naccept the harsh terms that Jesus demands in the opening sentence. By way of explanation, \nJewish literature and teachings of the first century often exaggerated certain phrases in order to \nemphasize their importance. What Jesus is saying here is exaggerating when He uses the words \n\"hating father and mother,\" etc. He does this to emphasize the importance of placing Onesimus \nwill be forgiven and received back as a free man and brother. This takes a great deal of faith, \nlove and humility on the part of all concerned.  \nAll Christians are disciples of Jesus today if they are truly trying to live according to the \nteachings of Christ and, as we have said, the cost of discipleship is very high; but so are the \nrewards. We cannot put a “price” on the value of salvation because the alternative is damnation. \nSo this should cause each of one of us to ask ourselves: \"Are we willing to place all that we \nhave and all that we are at the feet of Jesus Christ in order to be His disciple?\" Something \nto think about during your prayer time this week!
