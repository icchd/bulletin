   "text": "*“Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The winding roads shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.” Luke 3:5–6*\n\nThese, the words of the prophet Isaiah, were spoken about the mission of Saint John the Baptist. John was to “Prepare the way of the Lord” and to “make straight his paths.” In prophesying this, Isaiah goes on to give this very descriptive image of John’s ministry. It would be one that levels mountains and valleys, straightens every winding road, and smooths out the rough terrain. In other words, John came to remove every obstacle to God, making it easy to encounter the Messiah.\n\nHow does John complete this mission? By calling the people of that time to the dry and empty desert where all the false allurements cease to exist. This is done by detachment from the many sins and temptations they faced. Their repentance was an act by which the people humbled themselves before God, admitted their sins and acknowledged their need for a Savior. This humble admission, coupled with the commitment to change their ways, prepared heart after heart for the grace and mercy that came through Christ the Lord.\n\nToday, there are countless obstacles to grace that so many people encounter. Some have been drawn into the satisfactions of earthly riches and material comforts and find little need for God. Others have very little that this world can offer but are consumed with a desire for money and the passing comforts it promises. And still others are drawn into many other forms of sins and false satisfactions. But there are some who are like a dry and deserted desert, just waiting to soak up the gentle rain of God’s grace. These are those who have sought to detach themselves from the false promises of this world and remain “empty” and “dry” so as to be prepared for the abundance of grace when it comes. These holy souls have heeded the call to repentance and have humbly acknowledged their need for the Savior.\n\nReflect, today, upon whether or not your soul is like that dry and barren desert, detached from all the false and passing satisfactions of this world, and prepared to soak up the mercy and grace of God alone. Repentance brings forth detachment, and detachment prepares the soul for God. When one is truly detached and free from the many obstacles to God, then the road from God to your soul will be straight and easily traveled. Reflect upon your soul today and where you see unhealthy attachments. Repent with all your heart so that you are among those most fully ready for an abundance of the grace and mercy of God.\n\n*Lord, I turn to You in my need and repent of the many lies and false promises of satisfaction in this world. Please free me from all that is not of You so that my soul will be more fully prepared to soak You and Your mercy up like a gentle rain upon a dry and barren desert. I open myself to You, my Lord. Come fill and satiate my soul. Jesus, I trust in You.*",
