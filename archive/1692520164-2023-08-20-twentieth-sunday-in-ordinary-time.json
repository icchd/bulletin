   "text": "###Food for Dogs?\n\nSunday’s Gospel can give a headache both to preachers and to people in the pews. Jesus refuses to hear a Canaanite woman because she is, in his metaphor, one of the “dogs.”\n\n*OUCH.*\n\nYou know the story. The Canaanite woman cries out for help and Jesus at first will not even talk to her. The disciples demand that he send her away because she is a trouble-maker, and he seems to agree with them. “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,” he says.\n\nIf she is from Canaan, she is not from Israel.\n\n Finally, the poor woman walks right up, does “homage” to Jesus and says, “Lord, help me.” Jesus would never ignore such words, at least so we Christians and Catholics believe. Nor should we ever be deaf to words like this in our own daily lives.\n\nHowever.\n\nHowever, he says to her, “It is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.”\n\nOuch indeed. This is the line that is so hard for us to understand. So un-Jesus-like.\n\nThere are clues. She first called out to him with the words “Son of David.” This is a term hallowed by use in the ancient Hebrew scriptures, always referring to the Messiah. She is a Canaanite, and they did not believe in any Messiah-to-come, especially not one that would descend from David. Yet this woman, against her whole background, seems to show a belief in Jesus as Messiah.\n\nShe then calls him “Lord.” This is an explicit admission in Matthew’s Gospel that Jesus and God are one. Going just on her language, it is proof that she believed in him as the Savior.\n\nSurely, he sensed this.\n\nBut Israelites and Canaanites had long been in strife. How could “they” with their strange gods produce a woman who believes in the one God and in Jesus as the Christ? Is it possible that Jesus was drawing her out, teasing her in order to strengthen her belief?\n\nPerhaps he was quoting the word “dogs” as a reference to names the two peoples called each other. Something like this: “my people of Israel believe in the one God and your people do not. How can I give their food to you ‘dogs,’ as we call you?”\n\nThe woman’s quick wit provides a wonderful, humble, bantering response that wins the day. She says, “even dogs eat scraps that fall from their master’s table.” It is a riposte, a parry, a counter-thrust, and Jesus loves it. She is saying, “It does not matter what a person’s status is as long as they believe. And look, Lord, I do believe.”\n\nI’ll bet Jesus smiled a great smile as he told her how great her faith was. Maybe he laughed at her fast repartee. And of course he gladly gave her what she asked: he cured her daughter.\n\nDoesn’t Christ’s Holy Spirit smile within you and me when you ask for what you need; when you let nothing stand in the way, like your own origins, your status in life, your sins, and maybe even your rejection by others?\n\nRemember when you approached Communion and held out your hands and said in effect, “Son of David, have pity on me.” This is a paraphrase of the Canaanite woman. Our response is “Amen,” which means “I do believe,” just like the woman.\n\nLet us mean it this Sunday.",
