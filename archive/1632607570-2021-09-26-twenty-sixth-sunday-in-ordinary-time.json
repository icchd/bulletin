   "text": "###Glimpses of God’s Goodness\n\nOur Gospel for today is certainly challenging! It has two sections. The first focuses on who can do the works of grace in the name of Jesus.  It opens with John notifying Jesus that someone who was apparently not a follower of Jesus was driving out demons.  An outsider!! We listen to Jesus respond “Whoever is not against us is for us.” All good works come from God! Who are those in our lives who are the OUTSIDER and yet are leading lives of care and service of others? We probably do not have to look far to find those among our families and acquaintances.\n\nAgain is this an invitation to have hearts as wide as the world? We must have hearts that embrace all who follow a different path, whether religiously or even politically, as long as they, too, are searching for the truth and justice for God. We can witness this occurring in different groups, Catholic, Christian, Muslim, etc. who are working to protect the environment, to help the poor, homeless, migrants.  The evening news often bring us such stories of the goodness of others.\n\nIn the second section of the Gospel we also hear the challenge to remove from our lives anything that may keep us from loving God and our neighbor. Surely this does not mean to physically harm our bodies “plucking out our eyes, etc.” but rather take out of our hearts those obstacles that keep us from being loving persons.  This may lead us to reflect on what are our blocks to following Jesus more completely.  They may possibly include fear, doubt in our own goodness, the desire to be in control, selfishness in all its forms…\n\nToday, we pray to have open hearts, generous hearts to respond to God’s call to ongoing transformation and proclaim God’s Goodness to all in our lives, in our world.",
