   "text": "In the Gospel Reading for today, there are two themes that seem to work together to support each other. The theme of Humility is predominating; but the theme of petitioning or asking the Lord God for our needs or wants should also be considered. Let us see how this is illustrated in  todayâ€™s readings.\n\nThe First Reading is from the Book of Prophet Isaiah (53:10-11). This passage is often read  during Holy Week. It is called the \"Song of the Suffering Servant\" because it described the One who is to come to save the Jewish People and, ultimately, all the People of God. The full text of this chapter of Isaiah should be read to appreciate how God sent His Servant, faithful and sinless though He was, to accept suffering and death in place of those who were guilty. Truly, this was the epitome of humility and service.\n\nThe Responsorial Psalm is Psalm (33:4-5; 18-22). This is the prayer of a truly humble person  who \"waits for the Lord\" and accepts what life has to offer because he knows (as it says later in  this Psalm) that the Word of the Lord and the works of the Lord are trustworthy.\n\nThe Second Reading is from the Letter to the Hebrews (4:14-16). This passage is a continuation of last week's Second Reading wherein the writer described Jesus as the ultimate High Priest. He then points out that Jesus, although God, because He was also human, experienced the same trials and sufferings that all human beings experience. Therefore, He can sympathize with our weaknesses. The writer then goes on to tell us that we can approach the throne of God without fear and with confidence, but we must also do so with humility.\n\nThe Gospel Reading is taken from the Gospel of Mark (10:35-45). Here we have the brothers,  James and John, asking the Lord Jesus for the privileged seats on either side of Him in heaven.  This certainly was presumptuous of them even to assume that because they were friends of Jesus, they were going to get to heaven in the first place. To ask for the favored places was the height of pride. However, Jesus used this event to cut to the heart of His message. He challenged them with the question, \"Can you drink the cup that I drink?\" This is the same as we might say today: \"Can you go the distance for me?\" or perhaps \"Can you serve me faithfully until the end?\" Jesus then turns to the subject of humility and service to others and ends with giving Himself as an example by saying, \"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life for the ransom of many,\" which is to imply \"Can you do the same for me?\".\n\nWe might then say that the message contained in these readings is: Be careful what you pray for. God might counter with something you did not expect. Instead, it is better to consider your  prayers of petition and to approach God with humility in accordance with His will, not yours. To  clarify further, true humility is not cringing timidity or lack of self-esteem; it is knowing and  accepting who you are and your place in God's Plan of Salvation, and being comfortable and  content with that. Something to think about during your prayer time this week.",
